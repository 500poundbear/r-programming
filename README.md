### Review

As I didn't pay for the course, I was not allowed to submit my solutions for the
different quizzes and assignments. I'm pretty certain they are more than 90%
correct.

#### Duration

"Completed" the course over 2 days. Course material was quite light.

It was quite easy to get started and the assignments were not very difficult to
complete.
